# Art Engine with Rust

Create `assets` directory and a new directory for every layer and put your assets in those directories.

Edit the `main.rs`.

> NOTE: Do not forget to build in release mode. It is 10-20x faster than plain `cargo run`.

## TODO

- [ ] Add command-line support
- [ ] Add odds for assets
- [ ] Better error handling mechanism
- [ ] Support Solana
